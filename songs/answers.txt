Overall, I felt that many of the songs that ranked high on the list were laid-back songs from stores.
Also, since there are many songs that have the theme of heartbreak, it seems that people prefer songs that make them feel relaxed and empathetic.


Possible reasons why the audio aura calculation method is not representative of listeners are as follows.
First of all, if a person uses Spotify to play music that is not his or her favorite,
but only plays what is popular at the time, there is no connection between that person's tastes and
the songs that are played. It is thought that it may become inappropriate regarding changes in mood.
The second type of music is the songs I play when playing with friends. Popular songs are often played in exciting situations,
regardless of the content of the lyrics, so it cannot be said that the aura of the song played is related to the person's mood.
From the above points, it can be said that audioras do not necessarily represent listeners.
